# Twilio Deployment Decisions Guide

## 1. Which Credentials to Use?

### **Start with TEST credentials** ✅
- **Why?**
  - No charges during testing
  - Safe to experiment
  - Easy to switch to live later
  - Browser-to-browser calling works the same in test mode

- **When to switch to LIVE?**
  - After everything is working correctly
  - When ready for production users
  - When you want to track real call usage

### Important Notes:
- **API Keys are separate** - Create one for TEST and one for LIVE in Twilio Console
- **Same process for both:**
  - TEST Account → Create API Key → Use TEST SID + TEST Auth Token
  - LIVE Account → Create API Key → Use LIVE SID + LIVE Auth Token
- **You can have both configured** - Just switch `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` when ready

## 2. Deployment to Render & Netlify

### **YES, deploy to test** ✅

**Here's why:**
- Browser-to-browser calling requires HTTPS in production
- Localhost works for initial testing, but real environment validates the full flow
- Both users need to be online simultaneously (easier to test with deployed apps)

### Deployment Checklist:

#### **Backend (Render):**

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC... (your TEST account SID)
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=... (your TEST auth token)
   TWILIO_API_KEY_SID=SK... (your TEST API Key SID)
   TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET=... (your TEST API Key Secret)
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER= (not needed for browser-to-browser, can leave empty)
   ENABLE_CALLING=true
   ```

2. **After deployment, get your backend URL:**
   - Should be: `https://your-app.onrender.com`
   - Make sure CORS includes your Netlify frontend URL

#### **Frontend (Netlify):**

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
   ```

2. **No additional Twilio config needed** - Frontend loads SDK from CDN

---

## 3. Webhook URLs Setup

### **For Basic Functionality: NOT REQUIRED** ✅

Browser-to-browser calling works **without webhooks**. The calls are handled directly by the Twilio Client SDK in the browser.

### **For Call History Tracking: OPTIONAL** (Recommended)

If you want to track call duration, status changes, etc., set up webhooks:

#### In Twilio Console:

1. Go to: **Console → Phone Numbers → Manage → Active Numbers**
   - For browser-to-browser, you don't need a phone number, but you can still set webhooks

2. **OR Go to:** **Console → Runtime → Settings → General**
   - Look for "Status Callback URL" or similar

3. **Webhook URLs to set:**

   ```
   Status Callback URL:
   https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/calls/webhook/status
   
   Outbound Call Webhook (if using):
   https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/calls/webhook/outbound
   ```

#### **Security Note:**
Currently, webhooks don't verify Twilio signatures (see comment in `call.routes.ts`). For production, you should add signature verification:

```typescript
// Future improvement: Verify Twilio webhook signature
// const signature = req.headers['x-twilio-signature'];
// const isValid = twilio.validateRequest(signature, url, params);
```

**For now, it's okay for testing** - these webhooks just update call records in the database.

## 4. Quick Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render**

```bash
cd FIX-BACKEND
# Make sure your code is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Add Twilio voice calling support"
git push

# Then on Render:
# 1. Go to your Render dashboard
# 2. Select your backend service
# 3. Go to "Environment" tab
# 4. Add all Twilio variables (TEST credentials)
# 5. Save and redeploy
```

### **Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Netlify**

```bash
cd FIX-FRONTEND
# Make sure your code is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Add Twilio call button component"
git push

# Then on Netlify:
# 1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
# 2. Select your site
# 3. Go to "Site settings → Environment variables"
# 4. Update VITE_API_BASE_URL to your Render backend URL
# 5. Redeploy
```

### **Step 3: Test the Integration**

1. Open your deployed frontend in **two browser tabs** (or two devices)
2. Log in as different users (client and handyman)
3. Navigate to a chat room for a booking
4. Click the call button in one tab
5. The other tab should receive the call

---

## 5. Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Entering chat room doesn't show Twilio errors in console
- [ ] Call button appears in chat interface
- [ ] Clicking call button requests microphone permission
- [ ] Call connects between two browser tabs
- [ ] Audio works (hear each other)
- [ ] Mute/unmute works
- [ ] End call works

---

## 6. Switching to Live Credentials

When ready for production:

1. Create API Key in **LIVE** Twilio account
2. Update Render environment variables:
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC... (LIVE)
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=... (LIVE)
   TWILIO_API_KEY_SID=SK... (LIVE)
   TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET=... (LIVE)
   ```
3. Redeploy backend
4. Test again with live credentials

**No frontend changes needed** - it uses whatever backend provides.

---

## Summary

✅ **Use TEST credentials first**  
✅ **Deploy to Render & Netlify to test**  
❌ **Webhooks NOT required for basic calling**  
✅ **Webhooks OPTIONAL for call history tracking**  
✅ **No phone number needed for browser-to-browser calling**

Your current setup is perfect for deployment! Just add the environment variables and deploy.
