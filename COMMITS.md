Commit msg:Client sign up Integration with database 1
Changes made: 
    *Changed the sign up interface of clerk to enter a username and address the user by the new username.
    *Integrated clerk sign up to trigger creating a new user in the database collection-clients with minimal data; username,email,clerkuserid, created time.
    *Here is the flow: 
    User Signs Up (Index.tsx)
├── Attempts to create client record once
├── If new user → Client created successfully
├── If existing user → Silently handles 409 conflict
└── User marked as processed (no infinite loops)

User Navigates to Dashboard (ClientDashboard.tsx)
├── Fetches client data from database
├── Displays clean, professional interface
└── No debug information cluttering the UI
Notes:getting errors for inline codes.

Commit msg: "Added autofil for the registration form"
Changes made: 
    *Instead of asking the user to provide the same information several times, we now use the existing client information of the same profile when a client registers as a service provider. keeping the access to edit if the client wants to do so.
    *Service provider dashboard now opens in a seperate tab for ease of access and separation of two profiles.

Commit msg: "Client location integration and progress synchronization"
Changes made: 
    •  Enhanced updateClientProfile to support clear-location: if `location` is empty, location is cleared and `coordinates` are unset using $unset
    •  Kept models unchanged (already support `location` string + `coordinates`); no migrations required
    •  Ensured API remains backward compatible and aligned with frontend progress logic and map‑only commit behavior
    • Fixed the location integration in the service provider registration form. now it lets the customer enter a close location and show suggestions then once the suggestion is selected it allows the user to adjust the location by moving the pin.
    • The same was added to the client profile to grab the precise location.
Notes: Backend now cleanly handles setting and removing client location/coordinates so client profile and dashboard progress remain consistent.
Next steps: Adjusting the database schemas to save co ordinates of the clients'and serviceproviders' location for distance calculation.

Commit msg: "Recent messages Api fix"
Changes made: 
    •  getUserChats API call had inconsistent URL patterns. 
        ClientAPI and HandymanAPI: /chat/user?userId=${userId}&userType=${userType} ✅
        ChatAPI: /chat/user/${userId}?userType=${userType} ❌
     As a solution, Fixed the ChatAPI to use the correct query parameter format that matches what the backend expects.
